TSprite
=======

TSprite is a TypeScript library for easily creating sprites and panels on an HTML5 canvas element.

TSprite attempts to be as simple to use as possible while being as performant as possible. It is not a complete game management system that locks you into a certain way of creating games. It shouldn't take long to pick up the concepts and get working. If it does then I have failed.

TSprite contains sprites, panels, some classes to help work with sprite sheets and animations, some sprite collections, and an animation loop utility.
