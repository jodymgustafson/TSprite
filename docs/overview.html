            <h3>What is TSprite?</h3>
            <p>TSprite is a TypeScript library for easily creating sprites and panels on an HTML5 canvas element.</p>
            <p>
                TSprite attempts to be as simple to use as possible while being as performant as possible.
                It is not a complete game management system that locks you into a certain way of creating games.
                It shouldn't take long to pick up the concepts and get working.
                If it does then I have failed.
            </p>
            <p>
                TSprite contains sprites, panels, some classes to help work with sprite sheets and animations, some sprite collections, and an animation loop utility.
            </p>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                TSprite should work in any modern browser that supports HTML5 canvas.
                For IE that means version 9+.
            </p>
            <h3>Sprites</h3>
            <p>
                TSprite sprites have a position, size and velocity.
                The velocity is defined in terms of pixels per second.
                Every time a sprite is updated its position is changed based on the amount of time that has elapsed and the velocity.
                This keeps them moving at the same speed no matter what the frame rate is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprites can be owner drawn using HTML canvas context primitives, from an image, or from a series of images in a sprite sheet for animations.
                TSprite provides classes to help easily create sprite sheets and extract images and animation frames from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                All sprites have default collision checking using a rectangle intersection algorithm.
                Sprites have one collision area by default which is the sprite's bounding rectangle.
                Unfortunately not all sprites fit neatly into a rectangle.
                Therefore you may define any number of collision areas inside a sprite to get more accurate collision detection.
            </p>
            <h3>Panels</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to sprites TSprite implements panels.
                Panels are rectangular areas of the screen.
                Panels can be used as a bounding areas to keep sprites from moving outside of them.
                Panels may have background images that can be tiled in any direction or stretched.
                There is also a scrolling panel that will scroll a background image in any direction.
            </p>
            <h3>Sprite Sheets</h3>
            <p>
                A sprite sheet is an image that contains any number of images.
                This allows you to define all of your images in one file reducing download time.
            </p>
            <p>
                TSprite makes it easy to work with sprite sheets.
                You can easily extract an image from any position inside the sprite sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also easily extract a number of images from a sprite sheet to use for animations.
                Your animation images may be arranged in any number of rows and columns.
                TSprite will extract the individual animation frames to be used by your sprite.
            </p>
            <h3>Animation Loop</h3>
            <p>
                The heart of any game is the animation loop.
                In HTML5 apps this is controlled by the getAnimationFrame() function.
            </p>
            <p>
                TSprite provides a class to manage the animation loop for your game.
                You can easily start and stop the loop and get information about performance.
                If an animation frame takes to long it will drop that frame.
                This usually happens when you are debugging and have your app stopped at a breakpoint.
            </p>
            <h3>Sprite Collections</h3>
            <p>
                TSprite provides some collection classes to help manage lists of sprites.
                They are designed to allow you to enumerate through the list and quickly add or delete sprites.
                There is a collection that sorts by z-order of the sprite that allows you to draw sprites in the correct order.
            </p>
            <h3>Project Orgnization</h3>
            <p>
                TSprite is broken up into a number of individual TypeScript files so you can include only the ones you need.
                Each file contains one or more classes.
                You can determine dependencies of a file by looking at the references defined at the top of the file.
            </p>

                <li>Base.ts - Contains all of the sprite base classes. Everything else depends on it.</li>
                <li>Panel.ts - Contains the code for panels</li>
                <li>Canvas.ts - Contains the code for HTML5 canvas sprites</li>
                <li>CanvasPanel.ts - Contains the code for HTML5 canvas panels</li>
                <li>AnimationLoop.ts - Contains the code for the animation loop</li>
